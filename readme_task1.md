# The Sparks Foundation

### The Sparks Foundation is a company which encourages students to participate in various virtual programs created by them.

#### I had been enrolled in Data Science Program and had assigned the task name "supervised ml".



* The Question asked was  what will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? The Languages assigned were Python, Power BI, Tableau.


#### I decided to go with python as decided to predict the model rather than visualizing in POwer BI. I had attached the detailed file named "Supervised ML" which contains The Solution for The Above Question.
